    &lt;p&gt;&lt;span/&gt;      This article introduces four categories for bots in the area of message-based applications. As the author states&lt;br/&gt;
    &amp;ldquo;To promote clarity, journalists, technologists, marketers, and business leaders need to choose their words more carefully in the ongoing conversation on chatbots, messenger bots, virtual assistants, conversational UI, and natural language interfaces (just a small sampling of the various labels these phenomena get slapped with).&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;
    He is doing that by 4 categories &lt;br/&gt;
    Click navigation: This is the simplest form of messaging bot. Dispensing altogether with custom text-field and voice input, these bots use images, radio buttons, and scripted text to traverse a logical and preset navigation flow.&lt;br/&gt;
    Keyword search: These are slightly more advanced bots that can search for keywords found within text fields or voice search input. Since natural language is not supported, these bots work well for small data sets with a limited number of potential search queries. &lt;br/&gt;

    Structured phrase matching: Structured phrase matching introduces the notion of natural language understanding (NLU) for short phrases with predictable keyword categories. &lt;br/&gt;
    Unrestricted natural language: This category presents an experience that is much more akin to a human conversation. Unrestricted natural language interfaces understand natural sentences of any structure, whether spoken or typed, and can engage in multipart, dynamically generated dialogue to disambiguate, complete, and resolve queries.&lt;br/&gt;

  &lt;div class="article"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;span/&gt;      This is a very interesting article which is exploiting the impact of naming a bot from a psychological interaction point of view.&lt;br/&gt;
    &amp;ldquo;A name can be a way of expressing trust in an object — or expressing control over it. In design terms, a name is a kind of affordance — a handle we can hold onto.&lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    When we name the tools we use, we assert control over them; we do that because we want to be the ones having the interaction, doing the job.&lt;br/&gt;
    The digital tools we make live in a completely different psychological landscape to the real world. We can’t get a handle on them, literally. There is no straight line from a tradesman’s hammer he can repair himself to a chatbot designed and built by a design team somewhere in California (or in Dublin, in our case).&lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    Names and identity lift the tools on the screen to a level above intuition. They make us see the tool in all its virtual glory, and place it in an entirely different context to the person using it — and not always a relationship that person asks for or appreciates&lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    As he states, introducing personality into technology might not be the way we become more comfortable.&lt;br/&gt;
    &amp;quot;There’s another school of thought in design, one that describes it as almost invisible. Siri and Alexa might have been thought of as examples of this type: you can’t really “see” them, and so they disappear into the background.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;span/&gt;      wit.ai released in this article in April 2016, their vision for conversational bots: an early beta of Bot Engine. Since they joined Facebook in 2014 months ago, the Wit community grew from 6,000 to 21,500 developers. &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    They shared their key concept around building a bot engine, grouped around the following questions&lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    - What is the user’s intent?&lt;br/&gt;
    - How should the bot respond?&lt;br/&gt;
    - What actions should it perform?&lt;br/&gt;
    - What question should it ask? &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;span/&gt;      Amir Shevat from Slack provides an excellent overview how the bot landscape evolved in the recent year.&lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    The article is accompanied by a bot landscape infographic which provides a good and structured overviw of the market.&lt;br/&gt;
    His take is that we are still very early in this game, and there are still major hurdles to overcome. We are still exploring the best use cases (and business cases) for bots&lt;br/&gt;
    The opportunity for the next year of the bot ecosystem is pretty big, and we might start to see winners in a few segments.&lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    When it comes to bots for work, there are a lot of opportunities to create the next big thing with bots that assist us in all aspects of work: HR, productivity, finance, sales, support, legal, IT, corporate travel, security, and more.&lt;br/&gt;
